 A graph database and graph analytics driven platform that allows Non-profits in various sectors, volunteer/user community and corporate sponsors actively engage with each other. Volunteers can raise relevant issues as suggestions to various Non-profits belonging to a specific cause. Recommendation engine to show custom recommendations for volunteers, non-profits regarding events based on interests in social causes and proximity was created. Search engine was built for non-profits, corporate sponsors and users using Cypher graph query language. Corporate sponsors can easily identify credible Non-profits to support and collaborate with to solve various problems in social space. 


 Backend : Neo4j for graph database creating, analysis and visualization; Cypher query language for developing various features; Python was used for designing the framework and as an interface between Neo4j and frontend.

 Frontend : Android studio + Realtime database hosted on Firebase ; Google maps API on the mobile App


 This repository includes backend files of our project. I will be updating the repository with front end related files later.
